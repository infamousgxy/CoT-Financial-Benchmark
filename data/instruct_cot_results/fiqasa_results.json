        "raw": "Step 1: Identify the key words and phrases in the text  \n- \"$BBRY\" – refers to BlackBerry stock, a financial entity  \n- \"Actually lost .03c per share\" – indicates a financial loss, albeit small (3 cents per share)  \n- \"if U incl VZ as no debt and 3.1 in Cash\" – suggests a hypothetical scenario where Verizon (VZ) is included, implying the company has no debt and $3.1 billion in cash  \n\nStep 2: Analyze what sentiment these words convey  \n- \"Lost .03c per share\" is a negative financial outcome, even if small. This phrase carries a negative connotation.  \n- However, the rest of the sentence provides context: the company has no debt and $3.1 billion in cash. These are positive financial indicators.  \n- The use of \"Actually\" may suggest a nuance — perhaps the loss is less bad than expected, or the positive factors (cash, no debt) are being highlighted to soften the impact of the loss.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The post is making a financial calculation or analysis, likely in a discussion about BlackBerry’s financial health.  \n- While the company reported a small loss, the mention of no debt and significant cash reserves suggests a strong balance sheet.  \n- The tone is factual and analytical rather than emotional. The sentiment is not overtly positive or negative but leans toward a neutral assessment with a slightly positive undertone due to the strong cash position.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \n- The core financial result (loss of 3 cents) is negative, but the context (no debt, high cash) is positive.  \n- The overall sentiment is not strongly negative because the loss is framed within a favorable financial context.  \n- It is not clearly positive either, as the loss is still acknowledged.  \n- Therefore, the sentiment is best classified as **Neutral**, as it presents a balanced, analytical view without strong emotional or evaluative language.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral",

While the strategy itself might be positive in the long term, the immediate market reaction is negative—investors are reacting poorly, as reflected in the falling share price. The tone is clearly focused on a negative outcome.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \nThe sentiment is negative because the headline emphasizes a decline in share price, which is a key indicator of investor concern or dissatisfaction.\n\nFinal Answer: Negative",

Resistance levels are areas where price may struggle to rise, and a downward trendline suggests a declining price trend.  \n- The phrase \"10 points north\" implies the resistance is above the current price, which may be seen as a hurdle for upward movement.  \n- There is no positive language (e.g., \"breakout,\" \"bullish,\" \"strong support,\" \"upward momentum\") or emotional tone suggesting optimism.  \n- The language is purely factual and analytical, focused on identifying obstacles in price movement.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The tone is neutral and technical, typical of a chart analysis.  \n- While the presence of resistance and a downward trendline suggests caution or bearishness, the post does not express emotion, judgment, or a clear recommendation (e.g., \"sell\" or \"buy\").  \n- It simply states observations from a chart, without implying a positive or negative outcome.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \n- Although the technical indicators point to a potentially negative market condition, the post itself is descriptive and lacks emotional or evaluative language.  \n- Therefore, the sentiment is best classified as **Neutral**, as it reports facts without expressing a positive or negative opinion.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral",

It implies underperformance relative to expectations.  \n- Even though the miss is small ($0.01), the fact that both EPS and revenue missed expectations is still a negative signal.  \n- There is no positive language (e.g., \"beat,\" \"exceeded,\" \"strong growth\") to offset the negative terms.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The post is factual and concise, reporting on a company's earnings shortfall.  \n- The tone is neutral in delivery, but the content itself is negative because it highlights underperformance.  \n- In financial markets, missing expectations—regardless of the margin—is generally viewed as a negative event.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \n- Despite the small miss, the fact that both earnings and revenue fell short of expectations indicates a negative outcome.  \n- Therefore, the sentiment of the post is best classified as **Negative**.\n\nFinal Answer: Negative",

The use of \"but\" suggests a contrast, where the negative aspect is tempered by a positive one. The overall tone is balanced — not overly pessimistic nor overly optimistic.\n\nStep 4: Final assessment\nWhile there is a negative element (\"less than stellar day\"), the fact that the stock held a key technical level provides a stabilizing, slightly positive note.

However, the presence of a link may suggest the post is sharing news, analysis, or a reaction to something related to TSLA.\n\nStep 2: Analyze what sentiment these words convey  \n- \"Timberrrr\" is not a standard financial term but is used colloquially, often in a playful or enthusiastic way. In financial or social media contexts, it's frequently used to signal a bullish (positive) sentiment, especially when associated with a stock rising or breaking a resistance level. The elongated spelling (\"Timberrrr\") adds emphasis and excitement.  \n- The mention of \"$TSLA\" alone is neutral, but when paired with an enthusiastic exclamation like \"Timberrrr,\" it suggests a reaction to a positive event (e.g., a price surge, good earnings, or a breakthrough).\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The tone is energetic and informal, typical of social media posts where users react emotionally to market movements.  \n- The use of \"Timberrrr\" is strongly associated with a \"tree falling\" metaphor, often used in trading communities to signal a stock breaking out or a major move—usually a positive one.  \n- There is no indication of fear, disappointment, or criticism. The absence of negative words or emojis (like 😢, 📉) further supports a positive tone.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \nBased on the enthusiastic language (\"Timberrrr\"), the context of a stock ticker ($TSLA), and the common usage of such phrases in bullish market sentiment, the overall sentiment is clearly positive.\n\nFinal Answer: Positive",

        "raw": "Step 1: Identify the key words and phrases in the text:\n- \"Here come the shorts marchin' in\" – This phrase refers to short sellers (investors betting against a stock) entering the market. The use of \"marchin'\" suggests a sense of movement or inevitability, often used in a somewhat dramatic or mocking tone.\n- \"$GMCR\" – This is the stock ticker symbol for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (now part of Keurig Dr Pepper). It indicates the subject of the post is this stock.\n- \"Lovin' it!\" – This is a playful, enthusiastic phrase, and it's a direct reference to the McDonald's slogan, which is often used ironically or humorously in financial contexts.\n\nStep 2: Analyze what sentiment these words convey:\n- \"Here come the shorts marchin' in\" – This phrase is typically used in a sarcastic or mocking way when a stock is expected to decline. It implies that short sellers are piling in, which is generally a bearish signal. However, the tone here is not necessarily fearful but rather ironic or even celebratory of the shorts' actions.\n- \"Lovin' it!\" – This phrase is clearly positive in tone, but when used in the context of short sellers \"marching in,\" it's likely ironic. The speaker is not actually loving the shorts coming in; instead, they're mocking the situation or perhaps expressing delight that the shorts are being proven wrong (if the stock is rising).\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone:\n- The post is short and uses irony. The phrase \"Lovin' it!\" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, especially when paired with the idea of shorts coming in. In financial Twitter culture, this kind of phrasing is often used by bulls (those who believe a stock will rise) to mock short sellers or to express confidence that the shorts are making a mistake.\n- The tone is playful and confident, suggesting the author is not worried about short sellers but rather amused or even pleased by their actions.\n\nStep 4: Final assessment:\n- Despite the mention of short sellers (a bearish signal), the overall sentiment is not negative. The use of \"Lovin' it!\" with a sarcastic or ironic tone indicates the author is actually bullish on the stock, possibly anticipating a short squeeze or a rise in price.\n- Therefore, the sentiment is best interpreted as **Positive**, as the author is expressing confidence and even amusement at the shorts' actions.\n\nFinal Answer: **Positive**",

It suggests that the price is not able to sustain a move upward and is being pushed back, which could indicate weakness.\n- The use of a question (\"Can it retest?\") introduces uncertainty, which is neither clearly positive nor negative but leans toward caution or skepticism.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The post is technical in nature, focused on price action and market behavior.\n- It does not express optimism, excitement, or confidence. Instead, it highlights a potential weakness (rejection) and questions future movement.\n- The tone is neutral to slightly negative due to the emphasis on rejection and uncertainty.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \nWhile the post is not overtly negative, the key phrase \"early rejection\" carries a bearish connotation, and the overall tone is cautious rather than optimistic. It does not express positive sentiment, nor is it purely neutral in sentiment due to the implied caution.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment is best classified as: **Negative**.\n\nFinal Answer: Negative",

The positive aspect (market near record) seems to be the dominant trend, as the overall movement is described as \"little changed\" rather than down. The falls in specific stocks are noted but do not appear to drag the broader market down significantly.\n\nStep 4: Determine the overall sentiment  \nWhile there is a negative element (two stocks falling), the overall tone is balanced with a positive undercurrent due to the market being near record levels and showing little change (implying stability and strength). The headline does not express alarm or decline, but rather a stable, slightly positive market environment.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral\n\nReason: The headline presents a mix of positive (market near record highs) and negative (specific stocks falling) elements, but the overall tone is balanced with minimal movement and no clear downward trend.

The tone is cautionary and pessimistic, reflecting concern about market overvaluation and potential underperformance.\n\nStep 4: Final decision\nThe overall sentiment is negative, as it conveys pessimism about both a specific stock and the broader market.\n\nFinal Answer: Negative",

        "raw": "Step 1: Identify key words and phrases\n- \"$EBAY\" – refers to the stock of eBay, indicating a financial context.\n- \"e-bay bay!\" – this appears to be a playful or enthusiastic way of referring to the stock, possibly with a tone of excitement or anticipation.\n- \"working on a couple daily dojis\" – \"doji\" is a candlestick pattern in technical analysis that indicates indecision in the market. The phrase suggests the stock is forming these patterns, which are often seen as potential reversal signals.\n- \"should continue to the downside\" – this is a clear bearish (negative) prediction, indicating the stock is expected to decline further.\n\nStep 2: Analyze sentiment of key phrases\n- \"e-bay bay!\" – this has a casual, possibly excited tone, but it's not clearly positive in a financial sense; it may be more of a trader's slang or meme-like expression.\n- \"working on a couple daily dojis\" – neutral to slightly bearish, as doji patterns are often seen as precursors to reversals, but not inherently positive or negative.\n- \"should continue to the downside\" – this is unambiguously negative, indicating a forecast of further price decline.\n\nStep 3: Consider overall context and tone\nThe post is from a technical analysis perspective, using trading jargon. While the opening exclamation might seem upbeat, the core message is a bearish outlook: the stock is forming patterns that suggest it may keep falling. The tone is analytical and predictive, with a clear negative forecast.\n\nStep 4: Final decision\nDespite the playful opener, the dominant sentiment is negative due to the explicit prediction of continued downward movement.\n\nFinal Answer: Negative",

It carries a negative connotation, suggesting that something adverse may be happening or is likely to happen.  \n- The use of a question format (\"Is...?\") adds a tone of uncertainty but does not neutralize the negative implication; instead, it invites concern or speculation about negative events.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The headline is framed as a question, which may seem neutral at first glance, but the choice of words like \"Trouble Brewing\" clearly signals a negative sentiment.  \n- Financial headlines that question whether trouble is brewing at major companies are typically associated with investor concern, potential risks, or negative developments.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \n- Despite the question format, the underlying sentiment is clearly negative due to the suggestive language about impending problems.\n\nFinal Answer: Negative",

The use of \"LOL!\" and \"No chit Sherlock!\" suggests the author is not seriously upset but rather joking about the stock dropping. The frustration toward \"shorts\" is expressed in a teasing way, not with genuine anger. The overall mood is more amused or cheeky than genuinely negative.\n\nStep 4: Final decision\nWhile there is a hint of frustration (\"darn those shorts!\"), the dominant tone is playful and humorous. The sentiment is not genuinely negative, nor is it a straightforward positive statement. However, the use of humor and sarcasm suggests the author is enjoying the situation (likely because the stock moving down benefits them, possibly as a long holder).\n\nTherefore, the sentiment is best classified as: **Positive**.\n\nFinal Answer: Positive",

While voluntary suggests responsibility and transparency, recalls are generally negative events as they indicate a product defect.  \n- \"Back seat issue\" implies a safety or quality concern, which is negative from a consumer and investor standpoint.  \n- The fact that it's a recall of over 2,000 vehicles adds weight to the issue, suggesting a meaningful problem.  \n- However, the use of \"voluntary\" may slightly mitigate the negative sentiment, as it shows the company is taking initiative rather than being forced by regulators.  \n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The post is factual and concise, reporting a recall event.  \n- There is no emotional language, praise, or criticism beyond the basic facts.  \n- The tone is informational, not celebratory or alarmist.  \n- In financial contexts, recalls are typically viewed as negative events because they can lead to costs, reputational damage, and potential safety concerns.  \n\nStep 4: Final assessment  \nWhile the voluntary nature of the recall adds a slight positive nuance (proactive behavior), the core content—recalling vehicles due to a defect—is a negative event. The sentiment is not positive, nor is it purely neutral; it leans toward negative due to the implications of a product defect. However, since the post is purely factual and lacks emotional or evaluative language, it could be argued as neutral. But in financial sentiment analysis, such news is generally categorized as negative because it signals a potential risk.\n\nFinal Answer: Negative",

The speaker is not genuinely congratulating short sellers; instead, they are mocking them, likely because the stock dropped or failed to break through a resistance level (60), which would benefit shorts.\n\nStep 3: Consider overall context and tone\nThe tone is sarcastic and critical. The speaker is expressing frustration at missing an opportunity and is sarcastically acknowledging the success of short sellers. This suggests the stock did not perform as expected (likely declined or failed to break 60), which is bad news for bulls (those who bought or expected a rise). The overall sentiment reflects disappointment and irony, not genuine positivity.\n\nStep 4: Final determination\nWhile the phrase \"congrats shorts\" might seem like a positive remark on the surface, it's clearly sarcastic and indicates the stock moved against the speaker’s expectations.

A \"rising\" RSI and MACD suggest upward momentum in the bond market.  \n- \"all this bond buying is signaling some bad moves for the market\" – This is a critical statement. \"Bad moves\" implies negative market developments, likely suggesting that increased bond buying (often seen as a flight to safety) is a sign of underlying market weakness or impending downturn.  \n- \"$SPY $UUP\" – SPY is an S&P 500 ETF, UUP is a USD ETF. These are mentioned in context, possibly indicating broader market and currency implications.\n\nStep 2: Analyze sentiment of key phrases  \n- \"rising RSI & MACD\" – Technically positive for TLT (bonds), but in context, it's not presented as a bullish signal for the overall market.  \n- \"signaling some bad moves for the market\" – This is clearly negative.

It implies the company is scaling back, which can be seen as a sign of weakness or caution.  \n- \"Plans To Divest From Lonmin\": Divesting from a subsidiary or investment typically indicates a strategic shift. While divestment can be neutral or even positive if it improves focus or efficiency, in the context of a budget cut, it may suggest that Glencore is exiting a non-performing or underperforming asset, possibly due to financial pressure.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \nThe headline describes two actions: cutting the budget and selling off a stake in Lonmin. Both are typically associated with cost management or strategic retreat. While divestment can be a positive move if it leads to improved performance, the combination with a budget cut suggests a company is tightening its belt, which is generally a sign of financial caution or difficulty.\n\nStep 4: Final assessment  \nThe overall sentiment leans toward caution or concern. The actions described are not inherently positive (like growth or profit increases), nor are they overtly negative (like a loss or scandal), but the context of budget cuts and divestment in a single headline points more toward a negative or at least a cautious outlook.\n\nFinal Answer: Negative",

While there is a polite compliment (\"nice chart\"), the core message is focused on a declining market trend and uncertainty about future lows. The tone is analytical but leans toward caution or pessimism.\n\nStep 4: Final determination  \nAlthough there is a neutral-to-positive opener (\"nice chart\"), the dominant sentiment is bearish due to the focus on a down channel and speculation about lower prices.

        "raw": "Step 1: Identify the key words and phrases in the text  \n- \"Standard Chartered\" – a major financial institution  \n- \"Shifts\" – implies a change in strategy  \n- \"Emerging-Markets Strategy\" – the focus of the change  \n- \"After Losses\" – indicates a negative event that prompted the change  \n\nStep 2: Analyze what sentiment these words convey  \n- \"Shifts\" is neutral on its own, but when paired with \"after losses,\" it suggests a reactive move.  \n- \"Losses\" is clearly a negative term, indicating financial or operational setbacks.  \n- The fact that a bank is changing its strategy due to losses implies that the previous strategy was not successful, which reflects poorly on the company’s performance.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The headline reports a strategic adjustment in response to financial losses.  \n- This is typically seen as a sign of trouble or underperformance, even if the shift is intended to be forward-looking.  \n- The tone is factual but carries an underlying implication of weakness or challenge.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \nWhile the headline does not explicitly state a positive outcome from the shift, the core event—changing strategy after losses—carries a negative connotation. The focus is on the negative trigger (losses), not on any positive result of the shift.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment of the headline is: **Negative**.\n\nFinal Answer: Negative",

The act of opening a probe is typically associated with scrutiny, which leans toward a negative or cautious tone.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The headline reports that Berkshire Hathaway (a major U.S. conglomerate) has revealed that one of its subsidiaries has connections to Iran.

        "raw": "Step 1: Identify the key words and phrases in the text  \n- \"$SPY $MITK\" – These are stock tickers, indicating financial instruments.  \n- \"fast 56pc dive\" – This phrase is critical. \"Fast\" suggests rapid movement, \"56pc\" means 56 percent, and \"dive\" implies a sharp decline in value.  \n- \"http://stks.co/3ffN\" – A link, likely to a financial or news source, but not sentiment-bearing on its own.  \n- \"$$\" – This could be a formatting artifact or emphasis, but it doesn't convey clear sentiment.\n\nStep 2: Analyze what sentiment these words convey  \n- \"56pc dive\" is a strong negative indicator. A 56% drop in value is a significant loss, and the word \"dive\" is inherently negative in financial contexts.  \n- The use of \"fast\" emphasizes the speed and severity of the decline, which amplifies the negative sentiment.  \n- There is no positive language (e.g., \"surge,\" \"gain,\" \"up,\" \"strong\") to counterbalance this.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The post is reporting a sharp, rapid decline in two stocks.  \n- The tone is factual but conveys alarm or concern due to the magnitude of the drop.  \n- The brevity and use of symbols like \"$$\" may suggest urgency or emphasis, reinforcing the negative nature of the event.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \n- The sentiment is clearly negative due to the mention of a 56% decline in stock value, described with strong negative language (\"dive\").\n\nFinal Answer: Negative",

It sets a routine or informational tone.\n- \"Shire's Deal for NPS\": This refers to a business transaction involving Shire (a pharmaceutical company) and NPS (likely a company or asset being acquired). The term \"deal\" in financial contexts often implies a merger, acquisition, or partnership, which can be positive or negative depending on the outcome, but the word itself is neutral.\n\nStep 2: Analyze what sentiment these words convey  \n- \"Shire's Deal\" suggests a corporate action, but without additional context (e.g., \"Shire's deal fails\" or \"Shire's deal approved\"), the term \"deal\" is neutral. It simply indicates a business transaction is underway or being discussed.\n- \"NPS\" is an acronym that could refer to a company or product, but without further detail, it doesn't carry inherent sentiment.\n- The phrase does not include emotional language, evaluative terms (like \"surge,\" \"collapse,\" \"loss,\" \"gain\"), or strong positive/negative indicators.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The headline is structured as a brief agenda item, likely from a financial news or market briefing. Its purpose is to inform, not to express judgment.\n- There is no indication of success, failure, market reaction, or financial impact.\n- The tone is purely informational and factual.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \n- Since the headline contains no positive or negative sentiment indicators and is purely descriptive of a business event, the sentiment is best classified as neutral.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral",

It suggests the breakout is not supported by strong volume, which is a red flag for traders.\n- The contrast (\"but\") indicates a cautionary tone, downplaying the positive potential of the breakout.\n\nStep 3: Consider overall context and tone\nThe post acknowledges a potential bullish move (breakout attempt), but immediately undermines it with a technical weakness (weak PVT). The tone is cautious and skeptical, suggesting that the breakout may not be reliable. This is not outright negative, nor is it clearly positive. It leans toward caution, which is a form of neutral sentiment with a slight negative bias.\n\nStep 4: Final decision\nWhile there is a hint of optimism in the idea of a breakout, the emphasis on \"weak PVT\" and the use of \"another attempt\" (implying past failures) dominate the sentiment. The overall tone is not supportive or enthusiastic, but rather cautious and slightly bearish.\n\nFinal Answer: Negative",

        "raw": "Step 1: Identify the key words and phrases in the text  \n- \"Lloyds Banking Group's share price lifts\" – this indicates a positive movement in the stock price.  \n- \"amid reports bank is poised to axe hundreds of UK jobs\" – this refers to job cuts, which is generally a negative development for employees and can signal cost-cutting or operational challenges.\n\nStep 2: Analyze what sentiment these words convey  \n- \"share price lifts\" is clearly positive, as rising share prices are typically seen as favorable for investors.  \n- \"axe hundreds of UK jobs\" is negative, as job losses are usually associated with poor morale, reduced workforce, and potential reputational damage.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \nThe headline presents a contrast: a positive financial indicator (rising share price) occurring at the same time as a negative corporate action (mass job cuts). However, in financial markets, share prices often react positively to cost-cutting measures (like layoffs) because they can improve profitability and efficiency. Therefore, the rise in share price may be a direct result of the anticipated cost savings from job reductions. This suggests that the market is interpreting the job cuts as a positive strategic move, despite the human cost.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \nWhile the job cuts are negative in nature, the headline emphasizes the positive outcome (share price lift) and frames it as the main event, with the job cuts as context. The overall sentiment of the headline is therefore driven by the positive financial result.\n\nFinal Answer: Positive",

        "raw": "Step 1: Identify key words and phrases\n- \"Slowly adding some $FIO here\" – indicates the person is purchasing the stock, which is a sign of interest or confidence.\n- \"gotta be careful\" – suggests caution, which could imply some risk awareness.\n- \"This will be one of biggest winners in 2012\" – a strong, positive prediction about future performance.\n\nStep 2: Analyze sentiment of key phrases\n- \"Slowly adding\" is a neutral-to-positive action, indicating gradual investment.\n- \"gotta be careful\" introduces a note of caution, which could slightly temper the sentiment.\n- \"one of biggest winners in 2012\" is highly positive and enthusiastic, showing strong belief in the stock's potential.\n\nStep 3: Consider overall context and tone\nDespite the cautionary note (\"gotta be careful\"), the dominant tone is optimistic and confident. The person is investing in the stock and making a bold, positive prediction about its future performance. The caution does not undermine the overall bullish sentiment; rather, it reflects a measured approach to a promising opportunity.\n\nStep 4: Final decision\nThe overall sentiment is clearly positive, as the strong belief in the stock's future success outweighs the minor caution.\n\nFinal Answer: Positive",

The phrase \"who cares\" suggests the recall does not deter the speaker, and the final statement reinforces their bullish sentiment toward Tesla.\n\nStep 4: Final decision\nThe overall sentiment is positive because the speaker is expressing confidence in Tesla despite a negative news item, and their action (buying stock) reflects optimism.\n\nFinal Answer: Positive",

A double bottom is a chart pattern that typically signals a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend, often seen as a bullish signal.  \n- \"5.2\" – This likely refers to a price level, possibly the support level or the price at which the pattern is forming.\n\nStep 2: Analyze what sentiment these words convey  \n- \"Double bottom\" is a technical pattern that traders interpret as a positive sign, suggesting the stock may be poised for an upward move after a period of decline.  \n- The mention of a specific price (5.2) in the context of a double bottom implies a potential buying opportunity or a key level of interest, which is generally viewed favorably in trading circles.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The post is concise and factual, but the use of a bullish technical pattern (double bottom) without any negative qualifiers suggests optimism about the stock’s future movement.  \n- There is no language indicating concern, fear, or uncertainty (e.g., \"risk\", \"decline\", \"warning\").  \n- The tone is neutral in expression but carries an underlying positive implication due to the technical pattern.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \nWhile the post is brief and lacks overt emotional language, the mention of a \"double bottom\" — a bullish technical pattern — indicates a positive outlook on the stock’s potential.

The use of \"boost\" is inherently positive, indicating growth or increase in investment.  \n- Increasing a stake in a company, especially by a major investor like Berkshire Hathaway, is generally seen as a sign of confidence in the company’s future.  \n- The fact that they are seeking to go above 10% suggests a significant commitment, which is typically interpreted as a positive signal in financial markets.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- This is a factual headline about a regulatory filing (likely with the SEC) to increase ownership.  \n- There is no negative language (e.g., \"concerns,\" \"loss,\" \"downgrade\").  \n- The tone is neutral in presentation but the underlying implication is positive: Berkshire Hathaway is increasing its investment in Wells Fargo, signaling confidence.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \nWhile the headline is factual and not emotionally charged, the action described—increasing a major stake in a company—carries a positive connotation in financial markets.

A long position means the investor expects these stocks to rise in value.  \n- \"Short: $VXX\" – Indicates a short position in VXX, which is an ETF that tracks the VIX (volatility index). A short position in VXX means the investor expects volatility to decrease (i.e., market calm).\n\nStep 2: Analyze what sentiment these words convey  \n- \"Long\" positions are generally associated with bullish sentiment (expectation of price increases).  \n- \"Short\" on VXX is a bearish bet on volatility, which is often interpreted as a belief that the market will stabilize or decline in volatility.  \n- However, the act of holding long positions in major stocks and shorting a volatility ETF is a common, strategic, and balanced approach in options trading.

The word \"end\" implies closure, and \"mega-deals\" suggests large, significant transactions. The phrase suggests that such large-scale mergers may no longer happen, which could be seen as a shift in market dynamics.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The headline is not celebrating the merger; instead, it's framing the merger as a sign that a broader trend (mega-deals in the exchange sector) is coming to an end.  \n- The implication is that the era of big, transformative mergers in the exchange industry may be over. This could be interpreted as a negative development for companies or investors who expected more such deals, or as a neutral observation about market maturity.  \n- There is no explicit praise or criticism of the merger itself, nor any mention of financial performance, profits, or market reaction. The focus is on the symbolic or trend-setting nature of the merger.\n\nStep 4: Final assessment  \n- The tone is observational and slightly cautionary, suggesting a shift in industry dynamics.  \n- It does not express clear optimism (positive) or pessimism (negative), but rather a neutral commentary on market trends.  \n- The headline does not convey a direct positive or negative outcome for any party, but rather a structural change.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral",

This phrase is generally neutral to positive in tone, as it implies initiative and a desire for success.  \n- The mention of \"SABMiller investors\" implies a corporate transaction, possibly a takeover or merger, which is often seen as a strategic move in business. Such moves are typically viewed positively if they lead to growth or expansion.  \n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The headline is reporting on AB InBev's strategy to gain support from SABMiller investors. This is a common scenario in corporate finance, especially during mergers or acquisitions.  \n- The tone is factual and forward-looking, with no negative language (e.g., \"struggles,\" \"resistance,\" \"failure\").

This suggests that the closures may be part of a strategic shift—perhaps due to changing consumer behavior (e.g., more online shopping), not poor performance. The fact that sales are rising while stores are being closed implies the company is adapting, possibly improving efficiency. The positive driver (rising sales) is presented as the reason for the action, which frames the closures as a response to success rather than failure.\n\nStep 4: Final assessment  \nAlthough store closures are typically negative, the context of rising sales suggests the company is making proactive, strategic changes. The overall sentiment is therefore more positive than negative, as the headline emphasizes growth (sales jump) as the underlying reason.\n\nFinal Answer: Positive",

In financial contexts, \"chasing\" a bank or institution often means seeking mergers, acquisitions, or partnerships, which can be seen as a sign of ambition or preparation.  \n- The mention of Brexit nearing introduces uncertainty and potential risk. However, the headline does not express fear, loss, or decline. Instead, it frames the action (chasing banks) as a response to the upcoming Brexit vote, suggesting preparation or strategic positioning.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The tone is factual and neutral in delivery. It reports an action (chasing banks) in anticipation of a major event (Brexit).  \n- There is no explicit positive or negative language (e.g., \"surge,\" \"crash,\" \"loss,\" \"gain,\" \"worried,\" \"boost\"). The action described is not inherently positive or negative—it's a strategic move in a high-stakes environment.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \n- While the context of Brexit is inherently uncertain and potentially negative, the headline itself does not express a negative sentiment. It also doesn’t express overt optimism or a positive outcome.  \n- The focus is on a strategic financial move in response to an event, without evaluative language.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment of the headline is best classified as: **Neutral**.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral",

This can be neutral or slightly negative if it implies a company is selling off assets, but in the context of mergers and acquisitions, it's often a standard part of corporate strategy.  \n- \"AB InBev plans acquisition of SABMiller\" is a major corporate move. Acquisitions are generally seen as positive for the acquiring company (AB InBev) as they expand market share, but may be neutral or slightly negative for the acquired company or its stakeholders, depending on context. However, in financial markets, such announcements are often viewed positively due to potential synergies and growth.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The headline reports a significant business development: a major brewing company (AB InBev) is planning to acquire another large player (SABMiller). This is a strategic move in the global beer industry and is typically seen as a positive development for the industry and the acquiring company.  \n- The fact that Peroni and Grolsch are being put up for sale is likely part of the regulatory or strategic divestiture required to gain approval for the acquisition. This is a common and expected part of large M&A deals and not inherently negative.  \n- The tone is factual and informational, without emotional language or criticism.\n\nStep 4: Final assessment  \n- While the sale of brands might raise concerns for some stakeholders, the overall sentiment of the headline is aligned with a major, strategic corporate expansion. In financial markets, such news is generally interpreted as positive due to growth potential and market consolidation.\n\nFinal Answer: Positive",

        "raw": "Step 1: Identify key words and phrases\n- \"$AAPL\" – refers to Apple stock, neutral in sentiment\n- \"Has broken its downtrend\" – this is a positive signal, indicating the stock has moved out of a period of declining prices\n- \"but 200DMA proving to be stiff resistance short term\" – this introduces a cautionary note; the 200-day moving average (200DMA) is acting as strong resistance, meaning the stock may struggle to rise further in the near term\n\nStep 2: Analyze sentiment of key phrases\n- \"Has broken its downtrend\" – clearly positive, as breaking a downtrend is often seen as a bullish technical signal\n- \"but... stiff resistance\" – introduces a negative or cautionary element, suggesting that upward momentum may be limited in the short term\n\nStep 3: Consider overall context and tone\nThe post presents a balanced view: it acknowledges a positive development (breaking the downtrend) but also highlights a short-term obstacle (resistance at 200DMA). The tone is analytical and factual, typical of technical analysis, rather than overly optimistic or pessimistic.\n\nStep 4: Final decision\nWhile there is a positive element (breaking downtrend), the presence of a significant short-term resistance limits the bullishness. The overall sentiment is not strongly positive or negative, but rather a neutral assessment of market conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral",

TODAY\" – This suggests urgency and implies the option is expiring today, which often means the trader is making a last-minute or high-risk bet.\n- \"Hitting HOD here\" – \"HOD\" likely stands for \"Highest of the Day,\" indicating the stock has reached a peak price for the day, which is a positive signal.\n\nStep 2: Analyze sentiment of key phrases\n- \"Long\" and \"call option\" are inherently positive in sentiment, as they reflect a bullish outlook.\n- \"Hitting HOD\" is a positive indicator, suggesting strong upward momentum.\n- The casual tone (\"umm.. TODAY\") adds a sense of excitement or confidence, not frustration or concern.\n\nStep 3: Consider overall context and tone\n- The post reflects a trader taking a confident, short-term bullish position with a call option expiring today.\n- The mention of \"HOD\" reinforces the positive momentum.\n- There is no indication of loss, regret, or caution—only action and optimism.\n\nStep 4: Final decision\nThe sentiment is clearly positive, as the trader is expressing confidence in a rising stock price and capitalizing on a strong move.\n\nFinal Answer: Positive",

While the idea of a takeover can be positive for investors (e.g., potential for a buyout premium), the framing emphasizes their current weakness (\"beaten-down\") rather than their strengths or growth potential. The tone is more analytical and cautionary than optimistic.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \nAlthough there is a hint of opportunity (takeover potential), the dominant sentiment is centered on weakness and underperformance.

Resistance refers to a price level where a stock tends to stop rising, while support is a level where it tends to stop falling. The phrase \"turned support\" suggests that a previous resistance level has now become a level where the stock is finding buying interest or stability.\n\nStep 2: Analyze what sentiment these words convey  \n- The phrase \"resistance turned support\" is generally seen as a positive technical signal in trading. It implies that the stock may now be more likely to rise or stabilize at that level, which can be interpreted as a bullish sign.  \n- The use of a question mark (\"?\") indicates uncertainty or inquiry, but it does not negate the positive connotation of the concept itself. It suggests the author is speculating or seeking confirmation, not expressing outright negativity.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The post is brief and technical, likely from a financial or trading community.  \n- The tone is neutral in expression (due to the question mark), but the underlying idea — a resistance level becoming support — is a positive development in technical analysis.  \n- There is no negative language (e.g., \"crash\", \"loss\", \"warning\") or overtly positive language (e.g., \"bullish\", \"great\", \"surge\"), but the concept itself leans toward optimism.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \n- While the tone is neutral due to the questioning nature, the sentiment of the idea being discussed is positive.  \n- In financial contexts, such a shift is typically interpreted as a favorable signal.\n\nFinal Answer: Positive",

A breakout is often interpreted as a sign of upward momentum, and staying above that level suggests the bullish trend may be continuing.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The post is brief and factual, but the mention of \"continues to consolidate above previous break out area\" implies ongoing strength. The use of \"continues\" suggests a positive continuation of a favorable pattern.  \n- In financial and technical analysis contexts, being above a breakout level is generally viewed as a positive sign, indicating potential for further upward movement.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \n- While the language is not overtly enthusiastic, the underlying technical signal is positive. The sentiment leans toward optimism about the stock’s performance.\n\nFinal Answer: Positive",

The use of \"F'ing\" adds emotional intensity.\n\nStep 2: Analyze sentiment of key words  \n- \"Go Long\" is clearly positive and bullish.  \n- \"until exp imo\" suggests confidence in the trade's timing and outcome.  \n- The phrase \"Unless europeans keeps F'ing around!\" introduces a negative sentiment toward external market factors (possibly European markets), but it's not directed at the stock or the trade itself—it's a caveat or warning about potential disruption. The tone is informal and expressive, but the core recommendation remains bullish.\n\nStep 3: Consider overall context and tone  \nThe post is a trading recommendation: buy ROST call options at $2.08 and hold until expiration, with a strong bullish stance. The expletive is used to emphasize frustration with external market noise, not to negate the positive outlook. The overall intent is to encourage action based on a positive view of the stock.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \nDespite the informal and slightly negative-sounding caveat, the dominant sentiment is clearly positive due to the strong bullish recommendation (\"Go Long\") and confidence in the trade.\n\nFinal Answer: Positive",

It means the stock price has reached its highest level ever, which is generally favorable for investors and the company.  \n- \"Takeover talk\" implies potential interest from another company (Shire), which often leads to increased share prices due to expectations of a premium being paid in a possible acquisition.

This is clearly a positive signal for Tesco.  \n- \"Drops\" is a negative term, indicating a decline in performance for Marks & Spencer. This conveys a negative sentiment for that company.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The headline compares two companies: one (Tesco) is performing very well, while the other (Marks & Spencer) is underperforming.  \n- The focus is on movement in the FTSE 100, a major stock index, so the headline is reporting on market performance.  \n- While one company is rising and the other falling, the headline emphasizes Tesco's leadership in a positive market move, which is likely the main point of interest. The mention of Marks & Spencer dropping is secondary and serves as a contrast.\n\nStep 4: Determine the overall sentiment  \n- The dominant sentiment is positive due to the emphasis on \"leap\" and \"leads\" — strong positive language.  \n- The negative aspect (Marks & Spencer drops) is present but does not outweigh the positive momentum highlighted for Tesco.  \n- In financial headlines, a \"leap\" in a major index with a leading company is generally interpreted as a positive market signal.\n\nFinal Answer: Positive",

      "output": {
        "raw": "1. Key words and phrases:\n- \"$SPY\": Refers to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, a major stock market index fund.\n- \"Looks like bear traps\": A bear trap is a situation where the price of a security appears to be declining (indicating a bearish trend), but then reverses sharply upward, trapping bearish investors who shorted the stock. This is generally a negative term in trading, as it implies false signals and potential losses.\n- \"getting laid faster than Cadbury Creme Eggs by the Easter Bunny\": This is a metaphorical and humorous exaggeration. The comparison to Cadbury Creme Eggs being \"laid\" (a pun on \"laid\" as in eggs being produced) by the Easter Bunny implies something is happening very quickly and abundantly. In this context, it's suggesting that bear traps are forming rapidly in the market.\n\n2. Sentiment of key phrases:\n- \"bear traps\" has a negative connotation in financial markets — it signals deception, risk, and potential losses for traders.\n- The humorous, exaggerated comparison does not soften the negative implication; instead, it emphasizes the rapid and possibly chaotic nature of these bear traps, which is not a positive sign for market stability.\n\n3. Overall context and tone:\n- The tone is sarcastic and informal, using humor to describe a potentially negative market condition.\n- The use of a pop culture reference (Easter Bunny and Cadbury Creme Eggs) adds levity, but the underlying message is about market volatility and deceptive price movements.\n- The focus is on the frequency and speed of bear traps, which suggests a concerning or unfavorable market environment.\n\n4. Final assessment:\nWhile the humor might make the post seem light-hearted, the core message is about the rapid occurrence of bear traps — a negative market phenomenon. The sentiment is not positive, nor is it neutral; it reflects a critical or pessimistic view of current market conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: Negative",

Note: $2,732 billion is an extremely high revenue figure for a single company (for context, the entire U.S. GDP is around $26 trillion), which may suggest a typo (likely meant to be $2.732 billion or $27.32 billion). However, regardless of accuracy, the statement is factual.\n\nStep 2: Analyze what sentiment these words convey  \n- \"is up today to report\" – The word \"up\" can imply a positive movement, but it's ambiguous without context (e.g., is the stock up, or is the company up to report?). However, in financial contexts, \"up\" often refers to stock price movement.  \n- The rest of the sentence is purely informational: expectations for EPS and revenue. There is no expression of approval, disappointment, optimism, or pessimism.  \n- No emotional language, exaggeration, or evaluative terms (e.g., \"surprise,\" \"beat,\" \"miss,\" \"strong,\" \"weak\") are present.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The tone is neutral and informational. It reports on an upcoming earnings release and market expectations without interpreting or reacting to them.  \n- Even though the stock is \"up,\" this could be due to market movement unrelated to the earnings report itself.  \n- There is no indication of whether the expectations are met, exceeded, or missed.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \n- The post does not express a clear positive or negative sentiment. It simply states facts about an upcoming earnings report and expectations.  \n- Therefore, the sentiment is best classified as **Neutral**.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral",

The use of \"but\" signals a contrast, highlighting that the positive development is not enough to overcome a persistent competitive shortfall.\n\nStep 4: Determine the overall sentiment  \nWhile there is a positive element (increased passengers), the overall tone is balanced or slightly negative due to the emphasis on falling short of a major competitor. The headline does not celebrate a milestone or major success but instead frames growth as insufficient in a competitive context.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral  \nReason: The headline contains both positive and negative elements, and the overall sentiment is balanced rather than clearly leaning toward optimism or pessimism.",

This is typically seen as a positive outcome, especially if the stake was undervalued or if the company is optimizing its portfolio.  \n- There is no indication of loss, failure, or negative consequences.  \n- The tone is factual and business-oriented, with no emotionally charged or critical language.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \nWhile the act of selling a stake could be seen as neutral in isolation, the fact that it is done for a significant sum (£90m) and to a major company like Alibaba suggests a favorable outcome.

It implies the price is approaching a key level (the 50-day SMA), which can be seen as a sign of momentum or potential support/resistance.  \n- The 50-day SMA is often viewed as a significant technical level. Crossing or reaching it can be interpreted as a bullish signal if the price is moving up toward it, especially if it's a breakout.  \n- \"Acquisition news\" is typically positive in the stock market, as acquisitions often signal growth, expansion, or increased confidence in the company’s future.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The sentence is factual and descriptive, reporting a technical price movement in response to news.  \n- There is no explicit emotional language (e.g., \"surge,\" \"soar,\" \"crash,\" \"fail\").  \n- However, the combination of \"runs into the 50sma\" and \"acquisition news\" suggests a favorable market reaction—acquisition news is positive, and price moving toward a key technical level can indicate strength.\n\nStep 4: Final assessment  \nWhile the language is neutral in tone, the underlying context (acquisition news + price approaching a key technical level) is generally interpreted positively in financial markets.

It suggests that the company performed well financially, which is generally favorable in financial news.  \n- \"several board changes\" is a neutral phrase. Board changes can be positive (e.g., bringing in new leadership) or negative (e.g., instability or conflict), but without additional context, it's neither clearly positive nor negative. It's a factual statement.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The headline starts with a strong positive statement about earnings growth, which is a major driver of investor sentiment.  \n- The second part about board changes is presented without evaluative language, so it doesn't override the positive tone.  \n- In financial headlines, when a company reports \"solid earnings growth,\" it typically signals good performance, and the mention of board changes is often incidental or routine.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \n- The dominant sentiment is positive due to the strong financial performance highlighted.  \n- The neutral element (board changes) does not detract from the overall positive tone.\n\nFinal Answer: Positive",

An RSI of 20 is often interpreted as a sign of oversold conditions, which can be seen as a potential buying opportunity in technical analysis. This is generally a neutral-to-positive signal in trading contexts, as it suggests the stock may be due for a rebound.  \n- \"just read Connors book\" – This is a neutral statement, indicating recent learning, but not inherently positive or negative. However, Connors' strategies often include trading based on oversold conditions, so this may imply the user is interpreting the RSI reading as a signal to act.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The tone is factual and analytical, not emotional. The user is reporting a technical indicator and referencing a book they’ve read.  \n- There is no explicit expression of excitement, fear, or disappointment.  \n- The mention of an oversold RSI (20) could be interpreted as a potential positive signal (buying opportunity), but the statement itself is neutral in tone.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \n- While the RSI value of 20 is a technical signal that could be seen as positive (oversold = potential rebound), the post does not express a clear sentiment toward the stock’s future performance.  \n- The user is simply stating a fact and referencing a book, without expressing optimism, pessimism, or judgment.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment is best classified as: **Neutral**.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral",

The use of \"steadies\" indicates a recovery or at least a halt in decline, which is a positive development. While the mention of \"Brexit dip\" refers to a negative past event, the overall message is about resilience and stabilization, which is favorable.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \nThe sentiment is not negative (despite referencing a dip), nor is it purely neutral — the focus on stabilization after a downturn carries a positive connotation.

        "raw": "Step 1: Identify the key words and phrases in the text  \n- \"Germanwings disaster\" – refers to a major aviation accident involving Germanwings, a low-cost airline, which is a negative event.  \n- \"will not affect image\" – suggests that the disaster will not have a negative impact on perception.  \n- \"budget air travel\" – refers to low-cost flying, which is the sector easyJet operates in.  \n- \"easyJet\" – the company being discussed, which is trying to reassure the public.\n\nStep 2: Analyze what sentiment these words convey  \n- \"Germanwings disaster\" is inherently negative, but the headline is not focusing on the disaster itself.  \n- The key phrase is \"will not affect image,\" which is a strong negative-to-positive shift. It implies that despite the disaster, the reputation of budget air travel remains intact.  \n- The fact that easyJet is making this statement suggests a defensive or reassuring tone, aiming to maintain confidence in budget airlines.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The headline is from easyJet, a budget airline, and it's attempting to distance its brand from the negative event associated with another low-cost carrier (Germanwings).  \n- The message is reassuring: the disaster won’t harm the perception of budget air travel in general.  \n- This is a strategic communication to maintain customer trust and confidence.\n\nStep 4: Final assessment  \n- While the event (Germanwings disaster) is negative, the headline’s message is that this negative event will not harm the image of budget air travel.  \n- The tone is reassuring and confidence-building, which is positive in intent.  \n- Therefore, the sentiment of the headline is **Positive**, as it conveys stability and resilience in the face of a crisis.\n\nFinal Answer: Positive",

A breakout from a descending channel typically indicates a potential reversal in a downtrend, often interpreted as a bullish signal.

It does not convey strong emotion but rather a cautious or speculative tone.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The post is discussing a technical breakout, which is a neutral-to-positive event in trading contexts.  \n- The use of a question mark at the end suggests the author is not certain about the outcome, indicating caution rather than confidence.  \n- There is no overtly negative language (e.g., \"crash\", \"failed\", \"bad\") or strongly positive language (e.g., \"bullish\", \"great move\", \"buy now\").  \n- The tone is observational and speculative, not emotionally charged.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \n- While the breakout itself is a positive technical signal, the overall sentiment of the post is not clearly positive due to the uncertainty expressed in \"will it hold?\"  \n- The post does not express clear optimism or pessimism.

        "raw": "Step 1: Identify the key words and phrases in the text  \n- \"Aviva shuts\" – indicates closure or termination of a business location  \n- \"Friends Life head office\" – refers to a specific office location of a subsidiary  \n- \"rapid integration move\" – suggests a swift corporate action, likely part of a larger restructuring or consolidation effort  \n\nStep 2: Analyze what sentiment these words convey  \n- \"shuts\" has a negative connotation, as it implies closure, which often leads to job losses, reduced operations, or disruption.  \n- \"head office\" closure is a significant event, typically viewed negatively by employees, local communities, and stakeholders.  \n- \"rapid integration move\" is a neutral or slightly positive corporate term, suggesting efficiency or strategic alignment, but it doesn't outweigh the negative impact of shutting down a major office.  \n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The headline reports a corporate action (shutting down an office) that is likely part of cost-cutting or restructuring. While \"integration\" may imply long-term strategic benefits, the immediate effect is negative (job losses, reduced presence).  \n- There is no mention of positive outcomes like growth, increased profits, or customer benefits.  \n- The tone is factual but leans toward negative due to the implications of closure.\n\nStep 4: Final decision  \nAlthough the integration aspect may have strategic benefits, the dominant sentiment in the headline is driven by the closure of a head office, which is generally perceived negatively in financial and business contexts.\n\nFinal Answer: Negative",

However, in business news, it is often used neutrally or even positively to indicate a company is gaining talent.  \n- The fact that a high-profile executive (Thiam) is being recruited suggests strength and ambition.  \n- \"Asian push\" implies strategic growth and expansion, which is generally viewed positively in financial markets.  \n\nStep 3: Consider the overall context and tone  \n- The headline reports a strategic move by Credit Suisse to strengthen its Asian operations by acquiring a key executive.  \n- While the act of poaching may imply competition, the focus is on growth and capability enhancement.  \n- There is no mention of negative outcomes (e.g., loss of talent, scandal, or failure).  \n- The tone is factual and forward-looking, emphasizing expansion and talent acquisition.\n\nStep 4: Final assessment  \nThe headline conveys a sense of strategic strength and growth, which are positive indicators in financial news.
